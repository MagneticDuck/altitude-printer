0d:0h:8m:54s   |  Magnetic Duck    hey actually
0d:0h:8m:59s   |  Magnetic Duck    do you have any scrims set up lately
0d:0h:8m:59s   |  Stam             hi..
0d:0h:9m:4s    |  Stam             no
0d:0h:9m:23s   |  Magnetic Duck    internal practices?
0d:0h:9m:34s   |  Stam             nope
0d:0h:9m:44s   |  Stam             yes i know that i suck leading a team\
0d:0h:9m:52s   |  Magnetic Duck    lol
0d:0h:9m:59s   |  Magnetic Duck    no other SL-bound teams are currently having any sort of organisation
0d:0h:10m:3s   |  Magnetic Duck    don't worry
0d:0h:10m:7s   |  Stam             phew
0d:0h:10m:22s  |  Magnetic Duck    they're still in very early phases of organisation
0d:0h:10m:31s  |  Magnetic Duck    but the ones that will come
0d:0h:10m:39s  |  Magnetic Duck    will have players with years of experience behind them
0d:0h:10m:48s  |  Stam             i know that also
0d:0h:10m:52s  |  Magnetic Duck    and perhaps will have already have played on the same rosters in the past
0d:0h:12m:52s  |  Stam             i wonder if i fit in the path
0d:0h:12m:57s  |  Stam             if i change this
0d:0h:13m:24s  |  Stam             no i dont
0d:0h:15m:14s  |  Magnetic Duck    you know
0d:0h:15m:21s  |  Magnetic Duck    it's easy to get in a bad rut on altitude
0d:0h:15m:25s  |  Magnetic Duck    do you know what I mean
0d:0h:15m:32s  |  Stam             no
0d:0h:15m:34s  |  Stam             explain me
0d:0h:16m:7s   |  Magnetic Duck    well, we all have objectives don't we
0d:0h:16m:12s  |  Stam             we do
0d:0h:16m:17s  |  Magnetic Duck    we have certain aspirations and hopes
0d:0h:16m:32s  |  Magnetic Duck    you want to win SL, I want to design SolemnSky
0d:0h:16m:44s  |  Magnetic Duck    but on a day-to-day basis
0d:0h:16m:50s  |  Magnetic Duck    what do you think really motivates us?
0d:0h:16m:58s  |  Stam             altitude
0d:0h:17m:16s  |  Magnetic Duck    because altitude becomes a habit doesn't it
0d:0h:17m:23s  |  Stam             it does
0d:0h:17m:35s  |  Stam             it has become an addiction to me
0d:0h:17m:38s  |  Magnetic Duck    is it a habit that works towards your objectives?
0d:0h:17m:47s  |  Stam             yes
0d:0h:18m:3s   |  Magnetic Duck    you might be mistaken
0d:0h:18m:14s  |  Stam             doesnt it?
0d:0h:18m:31s  |  Magnetic Duck    if you want to win SL you will want to get good at altitude
0d:0h:18m:48s  |  Magnetic Duck    your theory is that playing more altitude makes you better at altitude
0d:0h:18m:50s  |  Magnetic Duck    yes?
0d:0h:18m:50s  |  Stam             yes so?
0d:0h:18m:56s  |  Magnetic Duck    what if it didn't?
0d:0h:19m:15s  |  Stam             idk
0d:0h:19m:38s  |  Stam             what could make me better at altitude
0d:0h:19m:43s  |  Magnetic Duck    have you heard of the einstellung effect
0d:0h:19m:47s  |  Stam             if this isnt playing more alti\
0d:0h:19m:54s  |  Stam             no i havent
0d:0h:20m:23s  |  Magnetic Duck    it refers to the state of mechanized thought that comes from practicing
0d:0h:20m:40s  |  Magnetic Duck    when you practice, you don't just "get better" magically
0d:0h:21m:1s   |  Magnetic Duck    you teach yourself associations and behaviours
0d:0h:21m:13s  |  Stam             so 2 in 1 :D
0d:0h:21m:29s  |  Magnetic Duck    but not everything is good to learn
0d:0h:22m:4s   |  Magnetic Duck    if you become very good at killing planes, you forget about other things
0d:0h:22m:12s  |  Stam             yeah \
0d:0h:22m:14s  |  Stam             thats true
0d:0h:22m:21s  |  Stam             and had happenned to me
0d:0h:22m:32s  |  Stam             i wanted to lvl up by killing
0d:0h:22m:43s  |  Stam             and then i forgot how to play the ball
0d:0h:22m:48s  |  Stam             i mean
0d:0h:22m:52s  |  Stam             bad shooting
0d:0h:22m:59s  |  Stam             probs with my tricks
0d:0h:23m:45s  |  Magnetic Duck    to achieve your objectives
0d:0h:23m:53s  |  Magnetic Duck    you have to do all kinds of things
0d:0h:23m:56s  |  Magnetic Duck    and most importantly
0d:0h:24m:4s   |  Magnetic Duck    you have to do things you wouldn't normally do
0d:0h:24m:12s  |  Stam             like
0d:0h:24m:23s  |  Magnetic Duck    if success came to people for doing what they liked day after day
0d:0h:24m:29s  |  Magnetic Duck    everybody would succeed
0d:0h:24m:34s  |  Magnetic Duck    but that's not how success works
0d:0h:25m:9s   |  Magnetic Duck    you see what I mean
0d:0h:25m:11s  |  Stam             try new things every things every day
0d:0h:25m:21s  |  Magnetic Duck    not necessarily every day
0d:0h:25m:23s  |  Stam             *try new things every day
0d:0h:25m:25s  |  Magnetic Duck    and not necessarily new things
0d:0h:25m:34s  |  Stam             yeah but i got ur point
0d:0h:25m:37s  |  Magnetic Duck    but addiction never leads to success
0d:0h:25m:39s  |  Magnetic Duck    t
0d:0h:26m:11s  |  Magnetic Duck    altitude is easy to get addicted to
0d:0h:26m:22s  |  Stam             ofc it is
0d:0h:26m:30s  |  Magnetic Duck    it's hard to succeed at because of that
0d:0h:26m:43s  |  Magnetic Duck    you stop thinking about your real objectives
0d:0h:26m:51s  |  Magnetic Duck    and you just want to come to altitude and kill some planes or bomb some bases
0d:0h:26m:58s  |  Magnetic Duck    you forget what you really want
0d:0h:27m:22s  |  Stam             so what else can i do
0d:0h:27m:26s  |  Stam             than these?
0d:0h:27m:33s  |  Magnetic Duck    I have some suggestions
0d:0h:27m:38s  |  Stam             great
0d:0h:27m:53s  |  Magnetic Duck    do you have skype?
0d:0h:28m:0s   |  Stam             not yet
0d:0h:28m:2s   |  Magnetic Duck    it's a bit inconvenient to have to talk through altitude
0d:0h:28m:10s  |  Stam             i was thinking to create an account 2day
0d:0h:28m:14s  |  Magnetic Duck    do it
0d:0h:28m:24s  |  Magnetic Duck    even for just text chat
0d:0h:28m:32s  |  Stam             brb
0d:0h:31m:52s  |  Magnetic Duck    I'll be back in 12 minutes

4d:0h:50m:46s  |  {TBG} Skymonster not lagging for me
4d:0h:50m:55s  |  Magnetic Duck    unplayable
4d:0h:51m:1s   |  Magnetic Duck    we have to do something else
4d:0h:51m:18s  |  {TBG} Skymonster oh dear
4d:0h:51m:41s  |  Magnetic Duck    k
4d:0h:51m:45s  |  Magnetic Duck    not worth it
4d:0h:51m:49s  |  Magnetic Duck    we can talk about something else
4d:0h:51m:55s  |  Magnetic Duck    like
4d:0h:51m:56s  |  Stam             i am now ok
4d:0h:52m:0s   |  Stam             with lag
4d:0h:52m:0s   |  Magnetic Duck    how you're both using repair drone
4d:0h:52m:7s   |  Stam             idk y
4d:0h:52m:21s  |  Stam             just havent flexi unlocked
4d:0h:52m:30s  |  Stam             and sky cuz he is a whale
4d:0h:52m:40s  |  Stam             and repair fits with whales
4d:0h:52m:47s  |  Magnetic Duck    actually no
4d:0h:52m:55s  |  Magnetic Duck    flexi or rubber are currently
4d:0h:52m:58s  |  Magnetic Duck    the best choices for whale in ball
4d:0h:53m:26s  |  Magnetic Duck    have you seen plane compositions on ladder?
4d:0h:53m:26s  |  {TBG} Skymonster I like my drone....
4d:0h:54m:8s   |  Stam             gg
4d:0h:54m:12s  |  Magnetic Duck    yeah
4d:0h:54m:16s  |  Magnetic Duck    you should really think about your perks
4d:0h:54m:24s  |  Stam             me?
4d:0h:54m:27s  |  Stam             or sky?
4d:0h:54m:34s  |  Magnetic Duck    both of you
4d:0h:54m:39s  |  Magnetic Duck    repair drone is overused by inexperienced players
4d:0h:54m:46s  |  Stam             i use ta rev and flexi
4d:0h:54m:49s  |  Magnetic Duck    on randa, heavy armour is a typical choice
4d:0h:54m:51s  |  Stam             with randa
4d:0h:54m:55s  |  Magnetic Duck    on whale, flexi is a typical choice
4d:0h:55m:1s   |  Magnetic Duck    repair drone holds you back 
4d:0h:55m:7s   |  Magnetic Duck    ESPECIALLY in a mode like ball
4d:0h:55m:13s  |  Magnetic Duck    where the respawn times are short
4d:0h:55m:28s  |  Magnetic Duck    and map control / extended holding of positions doesn't exist
4d:0h:55m:37s  |  {TBG} Skymonster I don't have flexi yet
4d:0h:55m:38s  |  Magnetic Duck    ball is fast and furious
4d:0h:55m:49s  |  Stam             exactly
4d:0h:55m:52s  |  Magnetic Duck    repair drone is only typically used on bomber
4d:0h:55m:59s  |  Magnetic Duck    and that's because it can circle actively
4d:0h:56m:3s   |  Magnetic Duck    and even then
4d:0h:56m:9s   |  Magnetic Duck    heavy armour is usually the better bet
4d:0h:56m:20s  |  Magnetic Duck    perk decisions vary from mode to mode
4d:0h:56m:31s  |  {TBG} Skymonster sure
4d:0h:56m:42s  |  Magnetic Duck    you should make sure you're informed about those choices
4d:0h:56m:53s  |  Magnetic Duck    check guides on the forums, look at compositions in bladder and SL
4d:0h:57m:4s   |  Magnetic Duck    anyway
4d:0h:57m:5s   |  {TBG} Skymonster alright, thanks, will do
4d:0h:57m:18s  |  Magnetic Duck    how old are you skymonster
4d:0h:57m:27s  |  Magnetic Duck    just out of curiosity
4d:0h:57m:31s  |  Magnetic Duck    to get to know the kind of players on the team
4d:0h:57m:36s  |  {TBG} Skymonster :(
4d:0h:57m:38s  |  {TBG} Skymonster :-)
4d:0h:57m:39s  |  {TBG} Skymonster np
4d:0h:57m:46s  |  Stam             the only thing i know that he has a family
4d:0h:57m:51s  |  {TBG} Skymonster I am 42, living in sweden and have 3 kids
4d:0h:57m:54s  |  Magnetic Duck    okay
4d:0h:58m:17s  |  Magnetic Duck    good to have some age on the team, that's for sure
4d:0h:58m:35s  |  {TBG} Skymonster just on sundays I have trouble joining as I usually am with my band then
4d:0h:58m:51s  |  {TBG} Skymonster how about you?
4d:0h:59m:0s   |  Magnetic Duck    I'm 17, stam is 14
4d:0h:59m:9s   |  {TBG} Skymonster oh dear, so I am the grandfather?
4d:0h:59m:11s  |  {TBG} Skymonster :-)
4d:0h:59m:16s  |  Magnetic Duck    hey, do you have some team group practiced
4d:0h:59m:23s  |  Stam             no julkien is 34
4d:0h:59m:27s  |  Magnetic Duck    because if you don't have a lot of players showing up
4d:0h:59m:30s  |  Magnetic Duck    you should go to ladder
4d:0h:59m:42s  |  {TBG} Skymonster naaa, I usually just play for fun
4d:0h:59m:42s  |  Stam             they will come
4d:0h:59m:48s  |  Stam             dont worry duck
4d:1h:0m:0s    |  {TBG} Skymonster that's why I am a bit hesitating about joining this team
4d:1h:0m:2s    |  Magnetic Duck    because
4d:1h:0m:8s    |  {TBG} Skymonster I won't be able to commit too much time
4d:1h:0m:15s   |  Magnetic Duck    you should play bladder
4d:1h:0m:31s   |  Magnetic Duck    if you don't have enough players to play at least 5v5, you'll learn a lot more playing bladder than
4d:1h:0m:34s   |  Magnetic Duck    playing here today
4d:1h:0m:36s   |  Stam             yeah sky if it to play smthing on altitude play ball ladder
4d:1h:0m:48s   |  Magnetic Duck    what do you have planned
4d:1h:0m:56s   |  {TBG} Skymonster I have not planned anything :)
4d:1h:1m:16s   |  Stam             as i told u duck, first 1de then tdm and finally for dessert ball!
4d:1h:1m:41s   |  Magnetic Duck    you should not rely on 1de for anything substancial
4d:1h:1m:59s   |  Stam             so what it would be like
4d:1h:2m:4s    |  Stam             tdm and ballx2?
4d:1h:2m:4s    |  Magnetic Duck    having intuition for the flow of a ball game matters much more than staying alive for 3 minutes
4d:1h:2m:18s   |  Magnetic Duck    quite honestly
4d:1h:2m:29s   |  Magnetic Duck    the skills you can learn in tdm are ones you can learn easily in any pub server
4d:1h:2m:37s   |  Magnetic Duck    basic technique and tactics
4d:1h:2m:49s   |  Magnetic Duck    the meat and potatoes of any altitude player from the streets
4d:1h:2m:54s   |  Stam             yeh i wanna practise them at killing
4d:1h:3m:3s    |  Magnetic Duck    what makes a team get anywhere in SL is being good at playing ball as a team
4d:1h:3m:9s    |  {TBG} Skymonster guys, I will have to leave soon,
4d:1h:3m:14s   |  Stam             kk
4d:1h:3m:16s   |  Stam             sky
4d:1h:3m:26s   |  Magnetic Duck    if all us three go to bladder
4d:1h:3m:31s   |  Magnetic Duck    we can get things started fast
4d:1h:3m:35s   |  Magnetic Duck    there are 8 players there active
4d:1h:3m:39s   |  {TBG} Skymonster I think there was a misunderstanding, and though the training was at 19cet (and 18gmt)
4d:1h:3m:39s   |  Stam             going
4d:1h:3m:45s   |  {TBG} Skymonster is it 19gmt then?
